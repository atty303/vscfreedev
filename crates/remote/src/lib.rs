//! # Yuha Remote Library
//!
//! This crate provides the remote server-side implementation of Yuha.
//! It handles incoming client connections and executes requested operations
//! such as port forwarding, clipboard synchronization, and browser operations.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The remote server operates in a simple request-response mode, processing
//! incoming requests from clients and sending back responses. It uses a
//! polling-based approach for pseudo-bidirectional communication.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **IPC Module**: Inter-process communication for daemon mode
//! - **Request Processing**: Handles various client request types
//! - **System Integration**: Interfaces with local system resources
//!
//! ## Execution Modes
//!
//! The remote server can run in different modes:
//! - **Stdio Mode**: Communicate over stdin/stdout (default for SSH)
//! - **Daemon Mode**: Run as background service with IPC communication
