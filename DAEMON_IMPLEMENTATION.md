# Yuha Daemon Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the daemon implementation added to Yuha for managing persistent remote connections.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Daemon Module** (`crates/client/src/daemon/`)
   - Background service that manages remote connections
   - Listens on Unix domain socket (Linux/macOS) or named pipe (Windows)
   - Uses SessionManager for connection pooling and lifecycle management
   - Can be used by both CLI and GUI applications

2. **Daemon Protocol** (`crates/client/src/daemon_protocol.rs`)
   - Request/Response protocol for client-daemon communication
   - Supports session management and command execution
   - Located in client crate for shared use

3. **IPC Transports** (`crates/client/src/transport/`)
   - Unix domain socket transport (`unix.rs`)
   - Windows named pipe transport (`windows.rs`)

4. **Daemon Client** (`crates/client/src/daemon_client.rs`)
   - Client library for communicating with the daemon
   - Used by CLI and GUI to send commands to daemon

5. **CLI Integration** (`crates/cli/src/main.rs`)
   - New `daemon` subcommand for daemon management
   - `--no-daemon` flag for direct connections
   - Uses daemon from client crate

## Usage

### Daemon Management

```bash
# Start daemon (runs in background)
yuha daemon start

# Start daemon in foreground
yuha daemon start --foreground

# Check daemon status
yuha daemon status

# List active sessions
yuha daemon sessions

# Get session information
yuha daemon info <session-id>

# Stop daemon
yuha daemon stop
```

### Using Daemon with Connections

```bash
# Connect via daemon (default)
yuha ssh -H example.com -u user

# Connect directly without daemon
yuha ssh -H example.com -u user --no-daemon
```

## Benefits

1. **Connection Reuse**: Sessions persist across CLI invocations
2. **Performance**: No reconnection overhead for subsequent commands
3. **Centralized Management**: All connections managed in one place
4. **Session Pooling**: Automatic connection pooling for similar connections
5. **Multiple Clients**: Multiple CLI instances can share connections
6. **GUI Support**: Both CLI and GUI can access the same daemon

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Daemon module in client crate
- ✅ IPC server with Unix socket support
- ✅ Session management integration
- ✅ Daemon protocol definition
- ✅ Unix socket and Windows pipe transports
- ✅ Daemon client library
- ✅ CLI daemon management commands
- ✅ Shared daemon access for CLI and GUI

### TODO
- [ ] Refactor existing CLI commands to use daemon by default
- [ ] Implement actual client connection handling in daemon
- [ ] Add authentication/security for daemon connections
- [ ] Add daemon configuration file support
- [ ] Implement automatic daemon startup
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Complete CLI Integration**: Refactor SSH and Local commands to use daemon
2. **Enhance Handler**: Implement actual transport connections in daemon
3. **Add Security**: Implement authentication for daemon connections
4. **Testing**: Add integration tests for daemon functionality
